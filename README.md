IDinfo contains the row identifiers that apply to the rows for each of the data files contained in Data.zip​

Time series data are contained in the following files:​

GRFx, GRFy, GRFz, COPx, COPy, Mx, My, and Mz are not time-normalized​

AP_GRF_stance_N, ML_GRF_stance_N, V_GRF_stance_N, COPx_stance, and COPy_stance are time-normalized to stance (100 data points representing the time the foot is in contact with the ground)​

discrete contains all the features that we manually extracted (see the previous slide and the data dictionary for more explanation) – each feature is one column in this file​
